## About Elixir

"Elixir is a dynamic, functional language designed for building scalable and maintainable applications." -- [elixir-lang.org](http://elixir-lang.org/)

Elixir leverages the battle tested ErlangVM to build distributed and fault-tolerant systems with low-latency out of the box.

__Features__:

+ Scalable
+ Fault-tolerant
+ Functional Programming
+ Extensible
